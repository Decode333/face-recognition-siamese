https://github.com/Decode333/face-recognition-siamese.git

The project has functionalities to collect data, train the model and update the weights and the realtime face detection.
There are three modes data_collection, train and realtime for the specific functions.
Using CV2, the frames of images are captured from the camera and saved into class folder.
The siamese network model gets trained with the captured images and the weights are updated.
During the realtime face recognition using the camera feed, the class name of the face and the bounding box are shown simultaneously.

For easier processing and training on low end machines, only a light weighted subnetworks are desinged.

With the help of Flask, the above mentioned functions are performed through browser as web application.
